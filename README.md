🧠 Overview
DexTrotter is a modern decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to help users compare various DeFi actions such as token swaps, lending/borrowing, liquidity provisioning, and flash loans.

The platform aggregates real-time data from multiple protocols and DEXs to provide insights into the best available rates, fees, and yield opportunities. Our goal is to empower users with transparent, actionable data to make informed DeFi decisions.

🚀 Project Objectives
🌀 Iteration 1 – Informational Platform
The first iteration focuses on building a comparison tool that informs users about the best platforms for DeFi interactions.

Swap Comparison: Display best token swap rates across major DEXs (e.g. Uniswap, 1inch).

Lending Comparison: Compare lending/borrowing rates from platforms like Aave and Compound.

Liquidity Comparison: Highlight top liquidity pools and staking rewards.

Flash Loan Insights: Surface flash loan opportunities across protocols.

🔮 Iteration 2 – Interactive & Transactional Platform (Future)
The second iteration will enable users to interact directly with protocols through wallet integrations.

Perform swaps, lend/borrow, and stake directly from DexTrotter.

Add advanced trading tools like slippage control and fee optimization.

Visualize complex DeFi data using 3D graphics (Three.js).
